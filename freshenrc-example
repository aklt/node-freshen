# Example of a .freshenrc configuration file
#
# Place a file like this in the root of the directory you wish freshen to serve

# Send at most 1 message to browsers in this amount of milliseconds
# This is useful to avoid sending a lot of seperate requests to load
# files to browsers when the build process changes many files
delay: 150

# Should terminal logging be in color?
color: true

# Root directory to start freshen in, defaults to current directory '.'
# root: ''

# Directories to watch and serve, defaults to the value of `root` option
# path:
#   watch: 'src'
#   serve: 'build'

# RegExp to exclude directories that should not be watched.
# exclude: /\.git$/

# Files to reload in the browser when they change. The value of `change` should
# be either a string of suffix names separated by whitespace or an array of
# regular expressions.
# If report is not present, the browser will not reload files.
report:
  change: 'css html js'

# Run command each time a file matching one of the suffixes or regular
# expressions in deps changes.
# The value of `deps` can be a string of suffix names or an Array of RegExps
build:
  command: 'make'
  deps: 'less md html'

# Where to access server
url: 'http://localhost:5005'

## Supply a custom mimetypes file
# mimeTypesFile: "mime.types"

# Glob string with directory configurations for servers to start up

  "#{process.env.HOME}/projects/*/.freshenrc"
