# Example of a .freshenrc configuration file
#
# Place a file like this in the root of the directory you wish freshen to serve

# Send at most 1 message to browsers in this amount of milliseconds
# This is useful to avoid sending a lot of seperate requests to load
# files to browsers when the build process changes many files
delay: 150

# Should terminal logging be in color?
color: true

# All directories below the directory that freshen is started in will be
# watched. Use this option to set a regular expression matching directories that
# should not be watched.  Note that the root dir will always be included.
# exclude: /__foo/

# Files to reload in the browser when they change. The value of `change` should
# be either a string of suffix names separated by whitespace or an array of
# regular expressions.
report:
  change: 'css html js'

# Run a command each time a file with one of the suffixes in deps change.
# The value of `deps` can be a string of suffix names or an Array of RegExps
build:
  command: 'make'
  deps: 'less md html'

# Where to access server
url: 'http://localhost:5005'

## Supply a custom mimetypes file
# mimeTypesFile: "mime.types"
