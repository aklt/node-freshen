# Example of a .freshenrc configuration file
#
# Place a file like this in the root of the directory you wish freshen to serve

# All directories below the directory that freshen is started in will be
# watched. Use this option to set a regular expression matching directories that
# should not be watched.  The root dir will always be included.
# This may be an array of RegExps or a string of space separated regular
# expressions.
exclude: './.git ./node_modules'

# Files to reload in the browser when they change. The value of `change`
# may be an array of RegExps or a string of regular expressions.  If this is a
# string the end of line assertion '$' will be added to each
report:
  change: 'css html js'

# Run command each time a file matching one of the suffixes or regular
# expressions in deps changes.
# The value of `deps` may be an Array of RegExps or a string similar to
# report.change above
build:
  command: 'make'
  deps: 'less md html'

# Port to access server at
port: 1024

# # http proxy - note that this requires http-proxy to be installed so that
# # freshen can require it
# ############
# proxy:
#   # If a request matches this url
#   from:  '^/api/(.*)$'
#   # rewite it to this url and send it returning the result
#   to:    'http://localhost:8080/${1}'
#   # retry this amount of times before bailing
#   retry: 20

# Defaulted config values that can be overridden
