# Example of a .freshenrc configuration file
#
# Place a file like this in the root of the directory you wish freshen to serve

# All directories below the directory that freshen is started in will be
# watched. Use this option to set a regular expression matching directories that
# should not be watched.  Note that the root dir will always be included.
# exclude: /__foo/

# Files to reload in the browser when they change. The value of `change` should
# be either a string of suffix names separated by whitespace or an array of
# regular expressions.
report:
  change: 'css html js'

# Run command each time a file matching one of the suffixes or regular
# expressions in deps changes.
# The value of `deps` can be a string of suffix names or an Array of RegExps
build:
  command: 'make'
  deps: 'less md html'

# Where to access server
url: 'http://localhost:5005'

# http proxy - note that this requires http-proxy to be installed so that
# freshen can require it
############
proxy:
  # If a request matches this url
  from:  ^/api/(.*)$
  # rewite it to this url and send it returning the result
  to:    http://localhost:8080/${1}
  # retry this amount of times before bailing
  retry: 20
